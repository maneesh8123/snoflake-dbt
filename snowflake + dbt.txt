      snowflake + dbt
=============================
dbt = iniline level , model level , project.yml level configuration

important to learn concept 
=================================
Data Lake = aws S3
Metadata Driven Pipeline
Snowflake =
snowflake stage
jinja 
macro
run : dbt compile

===============
snowflake is a cloud data warehouse(olap) 

==> S3 is the Data lake in AWS

DBT 
===========
Modularization

Tech stack
===========
s3 data lake snowflake dbt GitHub

Environment Setup
===================
search aws account -> create account -> account name -'snf'
pwd = m4E_tk_+9r;z_Q<

snowflake account
username = Rahul123
yXdLVhDNC6H8pSv

Create S3 bucket

three bars = all services -> in storage click s3 ->create new bucket - name,
-> create bucket => can upload data directly to the bucket

best way - create containers(or folders)
create folder -> folder name source ->create folder

uploading data 
============
just drop the files then click to upload

=======================
load the data to snowflake from aws

got to catalog on the left side = > create a database
create a schema named as schema = (create table => from file)

create a table = > standard -> 
ddl =https://github.com/anshlambagit/Airbnb_Snowflake_DBT_Data_Engineer_Project/tree/main/DDL






===================

snowflake db = sdbt
schema - staging

upload data 

Catalog -> Create Database -> Create schema ->create table -> from file -> Browse file

dbt with snowflake installation
=====================================
python -m pip install dbt-core dbt-snowflake
git config --global --list
git init
git status
git branch -m main

git switch -c core

dbt init snowbt
1
account -> ACCOUNTADMIN -> Account aws -> view account details -> account identifier
username :Rahul123
pwd : yXdLVhDNC6H8pSv
role - ACCOUNTADMIN(ACCOUNTADMIN -> Account aws -> view account details -> Role)
ware house - > project (default - compute_wh)
database 
schema
threads                     
dbt debug      

============
project.yml
models:
  snowdbt:
    # Config indicated by + and applies to all files under models/example/
    bronze:
      +materialized: view
      schema: bronze

this same thing we can do in by creatgin a properties.yml file in each folder such as 
bronze, silver , gold each having its own and configuration will be like this

models:

  - name: model_name1
    config:
	materialized: view
  - name: model_name2
    config:
	materialized: view
use case : can customize model by model(in bornze layer some should be view ,some 
should be table or any kind)
